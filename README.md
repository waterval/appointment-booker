# Appointment Booking Platform

Appointment Booking Platform is great for business owners in the medical field that want to allow their patients to book available appointments in real-time.

The medical appointments platform will save both time and money on scheduling. This is beneficial for both the patients and the staff. Accenture has predicted the following stats for the end of 2019:

-   64% of patients will book appointments digitally
-   Self-scheduled appointments will create 3.2 billion dollar in value in the US
-   Average time for a patient to complete a scheduling call is 8.1 minutes
